        <p>Question -</p>
        <p>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), 
            which is calculated using the formula:<br>
            BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).(mass in kg and height in meter).<br>
            1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables<br>
            2. Calculate both their BMIs<br>
            3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.<br>
            4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3.
            (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). </p>
