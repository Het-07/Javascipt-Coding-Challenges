        <p>Question -</p>
        <p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. 
            The bills were $124, $48, and $268.<br>
            
            To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).<br>  
            He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 
            15% when the bill is between 50-200 dollars, and 10% if more than 200 dollars.<br>
            
            In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:<br>
            1. Containing all three tips (one for each bill).<br>
            2. Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).<br><br>
            
            (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100 = 0.2)</p>
