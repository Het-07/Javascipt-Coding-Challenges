        <p>Question -</p>
        <p>Remember Mark and John BMI Challenge. 
            Implement the same functionality with objects and methods.<br>
            
            1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height.<br>
            2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI.
            Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.<br>
            3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, 
            together with the full name and the respective BMI.
            Don't forget they might have the same BMI.<br>
            
            Remember: BMI = mass / heightË†2 = mass / (height * height).<br>
            (mass in kg and height in meter).</p>
